# 🧮 React Counter App

This is the first project in my **React Project Marathon** — a personal challenge to build multiple React apps to sharpen my skills and deepen my understanding of modern frontend development.

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ Increment the counter  
- ➖ Decrement the counter  
- 🔄 Reset the counter to zero  

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Mastered the `useState` hook for managing local component state
- Practiced handling user interactions with event listeners
- Built and styled a clean, functional UI using JSX and CSS

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React (Functional Components + Hooks)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (for basic styling)

## 🔮 What's Next

This project is just the beginning of my **React Project Marathon**. Up next: I'll be adding a **Dark/Light Mode Toggle** to this app — a feature that will help me dive into **conditional rendering** in React.

The goal is to:

- Dynamically switch themes based on user interaction
- Practice rendering different styles and components conditionally
- Explore how state and logic can shape the user experience

Stay tuned as this counter app evolves from a simple clicker into a more interactive and customizable UI playground.
